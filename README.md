![light-mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46b41d3b-7daa-4c9d-80fb-77abd4b2ba71)


A skin mod manager for Wuthering waves made with electron.js. This was a reference from [JASM](https://github.com/Jorixon/JASM/blob/main/README.md) a similar skin mod manager which supports multiple games.

**This is still in an early stage of development. Make backups and use at your own risk ⚠️** 


## Features
- Pretty and Customizable/Custom CSS UI
- Drag And Drop files directly into the app
- Automatically sort unsorted mods into respective character's folders
- Move Mods between characters
- Manage mods name, icon or delete(permanent delete) them
- Start XXMI or certain .exe or game directly from the app
- Copy Folders or .rar file


## Hotkeys
- None as of moment

## Download
Latest release can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/baka-aho/WSMM/releases) page. To start the app run ```Waves Skin Mod Manager.exe```, I suggest creating a shortcut to it.
You can either install the installer or portable version.
## Requirements
- 



### Limitations and Acknowledgements

- Changing the app's theme causes flickering in colors.
- Some bugs main menu where charcter list loads twice `Refresh Mods` usually fixes it
- App settings are stored here ```C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\waves-skin-mod-manager```
- Mod specific settings are stored within the mod folder themselves and are prefixed with ```.WSMM_```. idk i will try to add a config.json like JASM later on
